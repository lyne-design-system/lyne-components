The `sbb-journey-summary` displays the main information of a journey.
It contains information about the arrival and departure, the date when the journey takes place and how long the trip will be.
It also consists of a pearl-chain with arrival and departure time.
In addition to that, it is also possible to display the walktimes at the start and end of a journey.
The component has an unnamed slot where other elements can be added, i.e. buttons.

## Usage

The Example below shows how to render the component with a button in the slot.
To be displayed correctly, the trip prop has to include almost all properties mentioned in the table below.
It is important that the arrival and departure properties consist of a valid ISO 8601 date string.
If this is not the case, the times and the date will not be displayed.
If the tripBack prop is passed to the component a second journey-summary, without the header, is displayed.

```html
<sbb-journey-summary trip="{trip}"><sbb-button></sbb-button></sbb-journey-summary>
```

To simulate the current datetime, you can use the `now` property,
which accepts a `Date` or a timestamp in milliseconds (as number or string).
This is helpful if you need a specific state of the component.
