The `sbb-datepicker-next-day` is a component closely connected to the [sbb-datepicker](/docs/elements-sbb-datepicker-sbb-datepicker--docs);
when the two are used together, the `sbb-datepicker-next-day` can be used to choose
the date after the selected date, or tomorrow's date if the date-picker's input has no defined value.

The components can be connected using the `datePicker` property, which accepts the id of the `sbb-datepicker`,
or directly its reference.

```html
<input id="datepicker-input" />
<sbb-datepicker input="datepicker-input" id="datepicker"></sbb-datepicker>
<sbb-datepicker-next-day date-picker="datepicker"></sbb-datepicker-next-day>
```

## In `sbb-form-field`

If the two components are used within a [sbb-form-field](/docs/elements-sbb-form-field-sbb-form-field--docs),
they are automatically linked and the `sbb-datepicker-next-day` will be projected in the `suffix` slot of the `sbb-form-field`;
otherwise, they can be connected using the `datePicker` property as described above.

The `sbb-datepicker-next-day` has an internal disabled state, which is set looking at the `sbb-datepicker`'s input:
if it is disabled, or if the selected date is equal to the input's `max` attribute, the component is disabled.

```html
<sbb-form-field>
  <input />
  <sbb-datepicker></sbb-datepicker>
  <sbb-datepicker-next-day></sbb-datepicker-next-day>
</sbb-form-field>
```

NOTE: Since the component needs the `sbb-datepicker` to work properly,
both standalone or within the `sbb-form-field`, they must have the same parent element to be correctly connected.
