The `sbb-image` component is used to render an image.

Mainly from cdn.img.sbb.ch (with `imageSrc`), but we can set an external image too.
The size can be set with `pictureSizesConfig`.

In this case we can leave the value of the alt attribute blank, but the attribute itself still needs to be present. That way we can signal assistive technology, that they can skip the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The value eager is best used for images within the initial viewport. We want to load these images as fast as possible to improve the Core Web Vitals values. lazy on the other hand works best for images which are further down the page or invisible during the loading of the initial viewport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

In our case we will log the performance.mark into the PerformanceEntry API once the image is fully loaded. Performance monitoring tools like SpeedCurve or Lighthouse are then able to grab these entries from the PerformanceEntry API and give us additional information and insights about our page loading behaviour. We are then also able to monitor these values over a long period to see if our performance increases or decreases over time. Best to use lowercase strings here, separate words with underscores or dashes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `--sbb-image-aspect-ratio`  | `auto`                        | Can be used to override `aspectRatio` property. This way we can have, for example, an image component with an aspect ratio of 4/3 in smaller viewports and 16/9 in larger viewports. |
| `--sbb-image-border-radius` | `var(--sbb-border-radius-4x)` | Can be used to override the `borderRadius` property in case of different values for different viewports.                                                                             |
